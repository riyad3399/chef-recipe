              The first step in any effective health service is to consult with
              a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian or
              nutritionist. They can help assess your individual needs,
              preferences, and goals to develop a personalized plan.

              A natural diet would prioritize whole, unprocessed foods like
              fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and
              healthy fats. These foods are rich in nutrients and can help
              support weight gain in a healthy way.

              To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than you burn.
              However, it's important to do this in a healthy and sustainable
              way. A registered dietitian or nutritionist can help you determine
              your caloric needs and create a plan that supports healthy weight
              gain.
